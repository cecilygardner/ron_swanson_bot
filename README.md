Ron Bot" is an automated tool that creates an Asana task with a random 
Ron Swanson quote (featured in Parcs and Rec). Following the task creation the 
bot attaches a random image to the task. The images are stored in a folder called 
'images.' Before you can successfully run the script you will need to create this 
file and add your own Ron Swanson images (from the internet).
